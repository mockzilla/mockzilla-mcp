# Service Configuration

Each service can have its own `config.yml` file that controls runtime behavior like latency simulation, error injection, validation, and caching.

## Location

For compiled Go services, place `config.yml` in the `setup/` directory:

```
services/petstore/
└── setup/
    ├── config.yml      # Service configuration
    ├── codegen.yml     # Code generation settings
    └── openapi.yml     # OpenAPI specification
```

For the full server mode with mounted specs, use a directory structure with `config.yml` alongside your spec:

```
openapi/
└── petstore/
    ├── openapi.yml     # OpenAPI spec (must be named openapi.yml/yaml/json)
    └── config.yml      # Service config
```

Note: Flat specs like `openapi/petstore.yml` don't support config files - use the directory structure above.

For portable mode, use the `--config` flag instead. See Portable Mode (topic `engine/usage/portable`).

## Configuration Options

### Service Name

```yaml
name: petstore
```

The `name` property defines the **URL prefix** for all routes in this service.

For example, if your OpenAPI spec has `/pets` and `/pets/{id}`, they become:
- `GET /petstore/pets`
- `GET /petstore/pets/{id}`

This allows multiple APIs to coexist on the same server without route conflicts.

**How the name is determined:**

1. If `name` is set in `config.yml` → uses that name
2. Otherwise → inferred from directory name (e.g., `openapi/stripe/` → `stripe`)
3. For flat specs → inferred from filename (e.g., `openapi/petstore.yml` → `petstore`)

### History

```yaml
history:
  enabled: true           # Record request/response history (default: true)
  duration: 60m           # How long to keep entries (default: app-level history.duration)
  mask-headers:            # Header names to mask in history entries
    - Authorization
    - Cookie
    - Set-Cookie
    - X-Api-Key
```

When enabled (default), incoming requests and their responses are recorded in the service's history table. This data is available via the DB Explorer UI or the history API.

**Duration:** `duration` sets how long entries are kept before expiring. When unset, the service inherits the app-level `history.duration` (see App Configuration (topic `engine/config/app`)).

**Header masking:** Headers matching `mask-headers` patterns have their values replaced with asterisks, keeping only the last 4 characters visible. For example, `Bearer sk-proj-abc123` becomes `***********c123`.

Patterns support two forms:
- **Exact match** - `Authorization` matches only that header
- **Prefix match** - `X-Internal-*` matches any header starting with `X-Internal-`

Matching is case-insensitive. By default, `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, and `X-Api-Key` are masked.

**Shorthand:** to disable history entirely:

```yaml
history:
  enabled: false
```

The boolean shorthand `history: false` is also supported for backward compatibility.

### Latency

```yaml
# Request/response history
history:
  enabled: true
  duration: 60m
  mask-headers:
    - Authorization
    - Cookie
    - Set-Cookie
    - X-Api-Key

# Simulated latency for responses
latency: 100ms

# Latency distribution by percentile
latencies:
  p50: 50ms
  p90: 100ms
  p99: 500ms

# Error injection by percentile
errors:
  p5: 500   # 5% of requests return 500
  p10: 400  # 5% return 400 (p10 - p5)

# Per-endpoint latency/error overrides
endpoints:
  /pets/{id}:
    GET:
      latency: 500ms
    POST:
      errors:
        p10: 500

# Caching behavior
cache:
  requests: true  # Cache GET request responses

# Replay (record / playback) — see replay.md for full options
replay:
  duration: 24h
  auto-replay: false
  upstream-only: false
  endpoints:
    /path/{id}:
      POST:
        match:
          body:
            - data.name

# OpenAPI spec simplification
spec:
  simplify: false
  compress: false
  # optional-properties not set = keep all optional properties
  # optional-properties:
  #   min: 5
  #   max: 5
```

## Latency Simulation

Simulate real-world network conditions:

```yaml
# Fixed latency
latency: 100ms

# Or percentile-based distribution
latencies:
  p25: 10ms   # 25% of requests: 10ms
  p50: 50ms   # 25% of requests: 50ms  
  p90: 100ms  # 40% of requests: 100ms
  p99: 500ms  # 9% of requests: 500ms
  p100: 1s    # 1% of requests: 1s
```

## Error Injection

Test error handling by injecting HTTP errors:

```yaml
errors:
  p5: 500   # 5% return 500 Internal Server Error
  p10: 400  # 5% return 400 Bad Request
  p15: 429  # 5% return 429 Too Many Requests
```

Percentiles are cumulative - `p10: 400` means requests between p5 and p10 (5%) return 400.

## Endpoint-Level Overrides

Latency, errors, and upstream settings can be configured per endpoint using the `endpoints` block. Endpoint-level config completely overrides the matching service-level setting for matched requests. See Per-Endpoint Upstream for the upstream variant.

```yaml
latency: 50ms  # service default

endpoints:
  /pets/{id}:
    GET:
      latency: 500ms
    POST:
      latencies:
        p50: 100ms
        p90: 500ms
      errors:
        p10: 500
  /health:
    GET:
      latency: 0ms
```

Each endpoint is matched by path pattern and HTTP method. Path parameters (`{id}`) match any value, just like OpenAPI path parameters.

When a request matches an endpoint, only that endpoint's latency and error config is used; the service-level `latency`, `latencies`, and `errors` are ignored for that request. Requests that don't match any endpoint pattern fall back to the service-level settings.

In portable mode, the same structure lives in the service's own `config.yml`:

```yaml title="services/petstore/config.yml"
latency: 0ms
endpoints:
  /pets/{id}:
    GET:
      latency: 200ms
```

## Caching

Cache responses for GET requests:

```yaml
cache:
  requests: true  # Enable response caching
```

Cached responses are returned for identical GET requests, improving performance.

The cache is the history table rather than a store of its own, so it needs
`history.enabled` too. With history off nothing records a response, and every
lookup is a miss.

That also ties the cache to whatever a storage backend keeps. A backend may cap
the size of a stored body, and a response above its cap is never served from
the cache: it is regenerated on every request instead. Check your backend's
configuration if large responses are not being cached.

## Replay

Record and replay API responses based on request fields. See Replay (topic `engine/replay`) for full documentation.

```yaml
replay:
  duration: 24h
  auto-replay: false
  endpoints:
    /search:
      POST:
        match:
          body:
            - query
```

## Spec Simplification

Reduce complexity of large OpenAPI specs:

```yaml
spec:
  simplify: true   # Enable/disable simplification
  optional-properties:
    min: 5         # Keep exactly 5 optional properties (when min == max)
    max: 5
    # OR
    # min: 2       # Keep random number between 2-8 optional properties
    # max: 8
```

When `optional-properties` is not set, all optional properties are kept.
This helps with specs that have schemas with many optional fields.

## Spec Compression

A generated service embeds its OpenAPI spec so it can produce mock data at
runtime. Set `compress` to embed that spec gzipped instead of verbatim:

```yaml
spec:
  compress: true   # default: false
```

This shrinks the generated binary, typically to around a tenth of the embedded
spec's size, and costs a few milliseconds at startup to expand.

It is off by default because `//go:embed` resolves at compile time, so the
compressed spec is a build input rather than a build output. With `compress`
enabled, `mockzilla service generate` writes `setup/spec.gz` next to your
`setup/openapi.yml`, and that file has to be committed along with the generated
code: `go build` fails without it. The plain spec stays on disk for reading and
regeneration but is no longer embedded.

Turn it on for a project where binary size matters more than keeping a binary
file out of version control. Existing services are unaffected until regenerated.

## Upstream Proxy

Forward requests to a real backend:

```yaml
upstream:
  url: https://api.example.com
  timeout: 5s               # Request timeout (default: 5s)
  sticky-timeout: 30s       # Sticky source duration (default: 0 = disabled)
  headers:
    X-Custom-Header: value
  fail-on:                   # Return these statuses directly (default: 400-499 except 401, 403)
    - range: "400-499"
      except: [401, 403]
```

When configured, requests are proxied to the upstream server.
If the upstream fails (timeout, network error, or error status), Mockzilla falls back to generating mock responses.

### Per-Endpoint Upstream

Override the upstream for a single path and method by setting `upstream:` inside an `endpoints` entry. 
The endpoint upstream fully replaces the service-level upstream (URL, timeout, headers, fail-on, sticky-timeout) for matched requests. 
Other endpoints continue to use the service-level upstream, or no upstream when none is set.

```yaml
upstream:
  url: https://staging.example.com

endpoints:
  /auth/token:
    POST:
      upstream:
        url: https://prod.example.com
```

### Sticky Source

When any request to a service receives a generated (fallback) response, all subsequent requests to that service automatically skip upstream for the configured duration. This prevents dependent requests from hitting an upstream that is down or has no state from generated responses.

```yaml
upstream:
  url: https://api.example.com
  sticky-timeout: 30s   # 0 or omitted = disabled (default)
```

| Configuration | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Not set / `0` | Disabled - every request tries upstream normally |
| `sticky-timeout: 30s` | After a generator fallback, all requests skip upstream for 30s |

The sticky marker is cleared when the upstream returns a successful response, so normal routing resumes as soon as upstream is working again.

### Fail-On

Control which upstream error status codes are returned directly to the client instead of falling back to the generator:

```yaml
upstream:
  url: https://api.example.com
  fail-on:                     # Return these statuses directly (no generator fallback)
    - range: "400-499"
      except: [401, 403]
    - exact: 502
```

| Configuration | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Not set (omitted) | Default: `400-499` except `401` and `403` are returned directly |
| `fail-on: []` | Disabled - all errors fall back to the generator |
| `fail-on: [{range: "400-499"}]` | All 4xx returned directly (no exceptions) |

#### Body Matching

You can refine fail-on rules based on the response body using the `body` field.
The body is parsed as JSON and fields are matched using dot-notation paths.

```yaml
fail-on:
  - range: "400-499"
    body:
      default: fail            # "fail" (default) or "except"
      fail:                    # Fail when ALL conditions match
        - path: "code"
          equals: 496
      except:                  # Don't fail when ALL conditions match
        - path: "code"
          equals: 497
```

- `body.fail` - always fail when all conditions match (return error to client).
- `body.except` - never fail when all conditions match (fall through to generator).
- `body.default` - decides the outcome when neither `fail` nor `except` match, or when both match. Defaults to `"fail"`.
- `path` uses dot notation for nested fields (e.g. `"error.detail.code"`).
- `equals` supports any JSON-compatible value: string, number, boolean.
- Multiple conditions within `fail` or `except` are AND-ed: all must match.

**Examples:**

Don't fail on 400 when response body contains `"code": 496` (fall through to generator instead):

```yaml
fail-on:
  - range: "400-499"
    body:
      except:
        - path: "code"
          equals: 496
```

Only fail on 400 when body contains a specific error code:

```yaml
fail-on:
  - exact: 400
    body:
      default: except
      fail:
        - path: "error.code"
          equals: "VALIDATION_ERROR"
```

## Response Headers

Mockzilla adds the following headers to responses:

| Header | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `X-Mockzilla-Source` | `upstream`, `cache`, `generated`, `replay` | Indicates where the response came from |
| `X-Mockzilla-Duration` | e.g. `1.234ms` | Request processing time |
